    "# Indexes and Index-Organized Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are schema objects that can speed access to table rows. Index-organized tables are tables stored in an index structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "An **index** is an optional structure, associated with a table or **table cluster**, that can sometimes speed data access. Indexes are schema objects that are logically and physically independent of the data in the objects with which they are associated. Thus, you can drop or create an index without physically affecting the indexed table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an analogy, suppose an HR manager has a shelf of cardboard boxes. Folders containing employee information are inserted randomly in the boxes. The folder for employee Whalen (ID 200) is 10 folders up from the bottom of box 1, whereas the folder for King (ID 100) is at the bottom of box 3. To locate a folder, the manager looks at every folder in box 1 from bottom to top, and then moves from box to box until the folder is found. To speed access, the manager could create an index that sequentially lists every employee ID with its folder location:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ID 100: Box 3, position 1 (bottom)\n",
    "ID 101: Box 7, position 8 \n",
    "ID 200: Box 1, position 10\n",
    ".\n",
    ".\n",
    ".\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Benefits of Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "The absence or presence of an index does not require a change in the wording of any SQL statement. An index is a fast access path to a single row of data. It affects only the speed of execution. Given a data value that has been indexed, the index points directly to the location of the rows containing that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an index exists on one or more columns of a table, the database can in some cases retrieve a small set of randomly distributed rows from the table. Indexes are one of many means of reducing disk I/O. If a heap-organized table has no indexes, then the database must perform a **[full table scan](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-BF9B54D6-892E-4C3B-8536-38958ACC069D)** to find a value. For example, a **[query](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-CCF91C9F-A98A-498F-A84B-58A0FA16CD6E)** of location `2700` in the unindexed `hr.departments` table requires the database to search every row in every block. This approach does not scale well as data volumes increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, consider creating an index on a column in any of the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The indexed columns are queried frequently and return a small percentage of the total number of rows in the table.\n",
    "\n",

The index is a means to avoid a full table **[lock](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-6D016291-A487-4F88-BE0B-ACF8FA2AE72C)** that would otherwise be required if you update the parent table **[primary key](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-8640EFA5-276C-4812-A078-1F21F55F4200)**, merge into the parent table, or delete from the parent table.\n",

An unusable index can improve the performance of bulk loads. Instead of dropping an index and later re-creating it, you can make the index unusable and then rebuild it. Unusable indexes and index partitions do not consume space. When you make a usable index unusable, the database drops its index **[segment](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-EC12AA68-8C89-43B3-B1F9-3AABF7CAEB9F)**.\n",

Making an index invisible is an alternative to making it unusable or dropping it. Invisible indexes are especially useful for testing the removal of an index before dropping it or using indexes temporarily without affecting the overall application."

    "## How the Database Maintains Indexes\n",

    "Retrieval performance of indexed data remains almost constant, even as rows are inserted. However, the presence of many indexes on a table degrades **[DML](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-B5F2F112-1B33-41B5-B63D-9DC8F99A369D)** performance because the database must also update the indexes.\n",

    "The **[tablespace](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-AA66891C-71B2-4D55-8F64-0E427AE24E88)** of an index segment is either the default tablespace of the owner or a tablespace specifically named in the `CREATE INDEX` statement. For ease of administration you can store an index in a separate tablespace from its table. For example, you may choose not to back up tablespaces containing only indexes, which can be rebuilt, and so decrease the time and storage required for backups."

    "\n",
    "In Figure 3-1, the root branch block has an entry `0-40`, which points to the leftmost block in the next branch level. This branch block contains entries such as `0-10` and `11-19`. Each of these entries points to a leaf block that contains key values that fall in the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "A B-tree index is balanced because all leaf blocks automatically stay at the same depth. Thus, retrieval of any record from anywhere in the index takes approximately the same amount of time. The height of the index is the number of blocks required to go from the root block to a leaf block. The branch level is the height minus 1. In Figure 3-1, the index has a height of 3 and a branch level of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branch blocks store the minimum key prefix needed to make a branching decision between two keys. This technique enables the database to fit as much data as possible on each branch block. The branch blocks contain a pointer to the child block containing the key. The number of keys and pointers is limited by the block size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leaf blocks contain every indexed data value and a corresponding rowid used to locate the actual row. Each entry is sorted by (key, rowid). Within a leaf block, a key and rowid is linked to its left and right sibling entries. The leaf blocks themselves are also doubly linked.

    "Reversing the key solves the problem of contention for leaf blocks in the right side of a B-tree index. This problem can be especially acute in an Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) database in which multiple instances repeatedly modify the same block. For example, in an `orders` table the primary keys for orders are sequential. One instance in the cluster adds order 20, while another adds 21, with each instance writing its key to the same leaf block on the right-hand side of the index.\n",

Thus, the index is the data, and the data is the index. Applications manipulate index-organized tables just like heap-organized tables, using SQL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an analogy of an index-organized table, suppose a human resources manager has a book case of cardboard boxes. Each box is labeled with a number—1, 2, 3, 4, and so on—but the boxes do not sit on the shelves in sequential order.

Suppose a user requests the records for employees 107, 120, and 122. Instead of searching an index in one step and retrieving the folders in a separate step, the manager can search the folders in sequential order and retrieve each folder as found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Index-organized tables provide faster access to table rows by primary key or a valid prefix of the key. The presence of non-key columns of a row in the leaf block avoids an additional data block I/O. For example, the salary of employee 100 is stored in the index row itself.

    "### Secondary Indexes on Index-Organized Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "A **secondary index** is an index on an index-organized table. In a sense, it is an index on an index. The secondary index is an independent schema object and is stored separately from the index-organized table.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in \"[Rowid Data Types](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/tablecls.htm#GUID-0258C4C2-2BF2-445F-B1E1-F282A57A6859)\", Oracle Database uses row identifiers called logical rowids for index-organized tables. A **[logical rowid](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/glossary.htm#GUID-92AE2643-9DA4-4364-942F-81F006759302)** is a base64-encoded representation of the table primary key. The logical rowid length depends on the primary key length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows in index leaf blocks can move within or between blocks because of insertions. Rows in index-organized tables do not migrate as heap-organized rows do (see \"[Chained and Migrated Rows](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/logical.htm#GUID-49D4E586-57BF-4310-9EE9-2DD54108E651)\"). Because rows in index-organized tables do not have permanent physical addresses, the database uses logical rowids based on primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assume that the `departments` table is index-organized. The `location_id` column stores the ID of each department. The table stores rows as follows, with the last value as the location ID:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "10,Administration,200,1700\n",
    "20,Marketing,201,1800\n",
    "30,Purchasing,114,1700\n",
    "40,Human Resources,203,2400\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary index on the `location_id` column might have index entries as follows, where the value following the comma is the logical rowid:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1700,*BAFAJqoCwR/+ \n",
    "1700,*BAFAJqoCwQv+\n",
    "1800,*BAFAJqoCwRX+\n",
    "2400,*BAFAJqoCwSn+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary indexes provide fast and efficient access to index-organized tables using columns that are neither the primary key nor a prefix of the primary key. For example, a query of the names of departments whose ID is greater than 1700 could use the secondary index to speed data access."

Oracle Database can use physical guesses to probe directly into the leaf block of the index-organized table, bypassing the primary key search. When the physical location of a row changes, the logical rowid remains valid even if it contains a physical guess that is stale.\n",
