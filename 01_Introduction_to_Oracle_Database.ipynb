An information system could be a set of cardboard boxes containing manila folders along with rules for how to store and retrieve the folders. However, most companies today use a database to automate their information systems. A database is an organized collection of information treated as a unit.

    "\n",
    "SQL is a set-based declarative language that provides an interface to an RDBMS such as Oracle Database. In contrast to procedural languages such as C, which describe *how* things should be done, SQL is nonprocedural and describes *what* should be done.\n",

You can use PL/SQL to control the flow of a SQL program, use variables, and write error-handling procedures.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **transaction** is a logical, atomic unit of work that contains one or more SQL statements. An RDBMS must be able to group SQL statements so that they are either all committed, which means they are applied to the database, or all rolled back, which means they are undone.\n",

    "2. Increase the checking account.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Record the transaction in the transaction journal.\n",

    "Oracle Database guarantees that all three operations succeed or fail as a unit. For example, if a hardware failure prevents a statement in the transaction from executing, then the other statements must be rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions are one feature that set Oracle Database apart from a file system. If you perform an atomic operation that updates several files, and if the system fails halfway through, then the files will not be consistent. In contrast, a transaction moves an Oracle database from one consistent state to another.

    "\n",
    "If multiple users access the same data, then one way of managing concurrency is to make users wait. However, the goal of a DBMS is to reduce wait time so it is either nonexistent or negligible. All SQL statements that modify data must proceed with as little interference as possible. Destructive interactions, which are interactions that incorrectly update data or alter underlying data structures, must be avoided.\n",

Depending on the transaction isolation level, this point is the time at which the statement was opened or the time the transaction began. The Flashback Query feature enables you to specify this point in time explicitly.\n",

    "### Application Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The application architecture is the computing environment in which a database application connects to an Oracle database. The two most common database architectures are client/server and multitier.\n",

In this way, the load on the database decreases. The application server can serve as an interface between clients and multiple databases and provide an additional level of security.\n",

After a network session is established, Oracle Net acts as the data courier for both the client application and the database server, exchanging messages between them. Oracle Net can perform these jobs because it is located on each computer in the network.\n",

Client applications send connection requests to the listener, which manages the traffic of these requests to the database. When a connection is established, the client and database communicate directly.\n",
